					<h1> Hobbies</h1>
						<h3> Gaming</h3>
						<p> Throughout my life i've found alot of my time spent playing video games. Be it to console myself when upset, reward myself for an achievement, or Playing them just to have fun. In fact video games are what caused me to become interested in programming, I found myself asking how do video games work so I serched online and learned about programming, coding, and design. </p><br>
						<h3> Art</h3>
						<img src="images/artimg.png" alt="art img">
						<p> My art was inspired by video games as well, the stunning graphics of video games fascinated me. For years i've been drawing, although in most cases not very well. I love having the ability to bring all of my ideas to life and art gives me the ability to do so</p><br>
						<h3> Cooking</h3>
						<!--<img src="images/cookingimg.png" alt="cooking img" terible image this is a placeholder till i stop being lazy and make a new one>-->
						<p> My culinary adventure Began on 05/16/2013. Watching my mother prepare food fascinated me. I began to learn how to prepare my own food with mild success eventually replacing my mom as the cook of the house.</p>
